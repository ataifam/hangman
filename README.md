Hang-Man Minigame

This minigame uses Django on the backend and React.js on the frontend. Front-end code can be found in hangman-front/ and backend is located in hangman/. The frontend receives NLTK library generated words for users to play with via requests sent to the backend API. The JS library Axios is used to establish a connection between the frontend and backend API.
